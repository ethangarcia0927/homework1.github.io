                <h3>High-Level vs. Low-Level Languages</h3>
                    <p>
                        Programming languages are often classified by how closely they interact with hardware. <strong>Low-level languages</strong>, like Assembly, Communicate directly with the computer's processor.
                        <strong>High-level languages</strong>, like Python and Java, are easier for humans to read and write because they use more natural language elements
                    </p>

                <h3>Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages</h3>
                    <p>
                        A <strong>compiled language</strong> is converted into machine code before it runs. Examples include C and C++. These are fast and efficient but require a compilation step.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, an <strong>interpreted language</strong> executes instructions line by line at runtime.
                        Python and JavaScript are interpreted, which makes development easier.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Programming Paradigms</h3>
                <p>
                    Programming paradigms describe how code is structured and executed. The main paradigms are:
                    <h4>Procedural:</h4> 
                    <p>
                        Focuses on <em>how</em> a program operates. It uses explicit, step-by-step commands that directly change the state of the program. It tells the computer exactly what to do and how to do it.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Object-Oriented:</h4> 
                    <p>
                        Organizes code around data, or <em>objects</em>, rather than fucntions. Objects represent entities and combine both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. It models the problem domain in terms of interacting objects.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Functional:</h4> 
                    <p>
                        Treats computation as the evaulation of mathematical fuynctions and avoids changing state or mutable data. It emphasizes immutaability, pure functions, and expressions.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Logic:</h4> 
                    <p>
                        Based on formal logic and a set of facts and rules. THe programmer specifies the problem in terms of known facts and relationships, and the language's system uses an inference engine to find solutions or answer queries.
                    </p>

                </p>
            
                
            </div>

                <summary>Did You Know?</summary>
                <p>
                Many modern languages, like Python and Swift, actually combine multiple paradigms. They can be both 
                object-oriented and functional.
                </p>
