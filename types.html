      <h3>High-Level vs. Low-Level Languages</h3>
      <p>
        Programming languages are often classified by how closely they interact with hardware.
        <strong>Low-level languages</strong>, like Assembly, communicate directly with the computer’s processor.
        <strong>High-level languages</strong>, like Python and Java, are easier for humans to read and write
        because they use more natural language elements.

      <h3>Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>compiled language</strong> is converted into machine code before it runs. Examples include C and C++.
        These are fast and efficient but require a compilation step.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, an <strong>interpreted language</strong> executes instructions line by line at runtime.
        Python and JavaScript are interpreted, which makes development easier.

      <h3>Programming Paradigms</h3>
      <p>The main paradigms describe how code is structured and executed:</p>

      <h4>Procedural</h4>
      <p>
        Focuses on <em>how</em> a program operates: step-by-step commands that change program state explicitly.
      </p>

      <h4>Object-Oriented</h4>
      <p>
        Organizes code around data, or <em>objects</em>, rather than functions. Objects bundle data (attributes)
        with behavior (methods) to model real entities.
      </p>

      <h4>Functional</h4>
      <p>
        Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data.
        Emphasizes immutability and pure functions.
      </p>

      <h4>Logic</h4>
      <p>
        Based on formal logic with facts and rules. The programmer states relationships; an inference engine
        derives answers or solutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <details>
      <summary>Did You Know?</summary>
      <p>
        Many modern languages, like Python and Swift, combine multiple paradigms—they can be both
        object-oriented and functional.
