                <h3>Early Beginnings</h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of programming began long before computers as we know existed. In the 1800s, mathematician <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> is credited with writing the first algorithm intended for a machine, making her the world's first programmer.
                <p>
                    Each language serves its own unique purpose. For example, <strong>Python</strong> is known for its simplicity, <strong>C++</strong> for performance, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for web development.
                </p>

                <h3>The Rise of High-Level Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    During the 1960s and 70s, languages such as <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Pascal</strong>, and <strong>BASIC</strong> made programminbg more accessible. These languages helped developers write structured and portable code.
                </p>

                <h3>Modern Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    From the 1990s onward, new languages such as <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> became dominant. These focused on readability, portability, and web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, there are hundreds of programming languages, each designed for specific tasks, from web apps to artificial intelligence. The evolution continues with new languages like <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>go</strong> that focus on speed and safety.

                The name “Python” doesn't come from the snake, it was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python!
