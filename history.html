      <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
      <p>
        The concept of programming began long before modern computers. In the 1800s,
        mathematician <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> is credited with writing the first algorithm intended
        for a machine—often making her the world’s first programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each language serves its own purpose. For example, <strong>Python</strong> is known for simplicity,
        <strong>C++</strong> for performance, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for web development.

      <h3>The Rise of High-Level Languages</h3>
      <p>
        During the 1960s and 1970s, languages such as <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Pascal</strong>, and
        <strong>BASIC</strong> made programming more accessible and encouraged structured, portable code.

      <h3>Modern Programming</h3>
      <p>
        From the 1990s onward, languages like <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> became dominant, emphasizing readability, portability, and the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today there are hundreds of languages—covering everything from web apps to artificial intelligence.
        The evolution continues with newer languages like <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Go</strong> that focus on
        speed, safety, and concurrency.

      <p>
        The name “Python” doesn’t come from the snake—it was inspired by the British comedy group
        Monty Python!
